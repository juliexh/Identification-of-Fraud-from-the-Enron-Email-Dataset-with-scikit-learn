# Identification-of-fraud-from-the-Enron-email-dataset-with-scikit-learn
### Description of the Dataset
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

The dataset contained 146 records with 1 labeled feature (POI), 14 financial features, 6 email feature. Within these record, 18 were labeled as a "Person Of Interest" (POI). 
### The goal of the project
The goal of this project is to employ machine learning skills in building a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. The aim is to classify Enron employees into two categories: POI and non-POI. 
### Software
This project requires Python 2.x and the following Python libraries installed:
- matplotlib 
- numpy
